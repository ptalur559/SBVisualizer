# SBVisualizer

SBVisualizer is a Python package for visualizing flux in SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) models using SBMLDiagrams visualization. Flux of a reaction is illustrated with arrows of different thicknesses and colors, with thicker arrows representing a greater absolute value of flux and red representing positive flux, green representing 0 flux, and blue representing negative flux. The final output is a file with the diagram of each species and the flux arrows.
