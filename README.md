# SBVisualizer

Systems Biology Markup Language, or SBML, is a software model for biological reactions. SBVisualizer is a Python package for visualizing reaction fluxes in SBML models using SBMLDiagrams visualization. Flux of a reaction is illustrated with arrows of different thicknesses and colors, with thicker arrows representing a greater absolute value of flux and pure red representing positive flux, pure green representing 0 flux, and pure blue representing negative flux. The final output is a file with the diagram of each species and the flux arrows.
