One main Visualizer class (object) which takes in a roadrunner model made in Antimony 
  r = te.loada('model')
Reactions need to be named 

Necessary Outside Imports 
  tellurium, sbmlnetworks, SBMLDiagrams 
Functions
  loadIntoSBML - gets the SBML text and loads the model into SBMLDiagrams 
  get_fluxes - computes and compiles all the fluxes from each reaction in the model 
  set_line_thickness - user picks the species to change the line width of, and then based on that line width, the other arrows
are scaled accordingly 
  make_color_gradient - uses a RGB scale for each reaction, color scheme is more positive flux - red (255, 0, 0), more negative 
flux - blue (0, 0, 255), and 0 flux is green (0, 255, 0). Outputs the arrow color for each reaction flux, and user can use
sbmlnetworks to visualize these changes 
  rgb_to_hex - converts the RGB value found above to hexadecimal so that user can input it into sb.setLineColor() using
sbmlnetworks
